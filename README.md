# SKIN-CANCER-DETECTION-USING-CNN
Skin cancer is a common form of cancer, and early detection increases the survival rate. The diagnostic accuracy correlates strongly with the professional experience of the physician Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. It has 2 different classes of skin cancer Benign and Malignant. Here, we will try to detect 2 different classes of moles using Convolution Neural Network(CNN) with keras and TensorFlow library, ResNet in backend and then we will analyse the result to see how the model can be useful in practical scenario.
The benign tumor cells tend not to spread, whereas the malignant tumor cells can spread easily. Benign tumor grow slowly, whereas the malignant tumor grow fairly rapidly. Using Convolutional neural network, and ResNet50 , the benign mole and malignant mole are classified.
